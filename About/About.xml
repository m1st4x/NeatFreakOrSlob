This mod gives you control over the amount of filth pawns leave behind.
It lets you modify the chances for pickup filth (5%) and drop filth (10%) each time a pawn enters a new cell.
Changes apply to every pawn on the map!

Additionally two new traits were introduced: "neat freak" and "slob"

A slob doesn't care much about cleanliness, he
- has a significant higher chance to pickup, move around and drop filth.
- gets mood buff/debuff based on room cleanliness.
- gets mood debuff if assigned to cleaning job.
- has negative opinion about neat freaks

A neat freak instead hates dirt and mess, he
- has a reduced chance to pickup, move around and drop filth.
- gets mood buff/debuff based on room cleanliness.
- gets mood buff if assigned to cleaning job.
- has negative opinion about slobs

All values and thresholds are adjustable in the options.

Having one or more slobs in your team can make your colony a messy place.
Using door mats is recommended.

Use MoreTraitSlots to boost the propability of pawns having this traits.

Edb prepare carefully helps you to setup your starting pawns.

Compatibility:
No issues but some redundancy: Vanilla Traits Expanded adds two traits with similar behavior, however less detailed und not adjustable.

Have fun!
